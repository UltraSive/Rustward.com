Hey there!

Thanks for purchasing my product. I hope you enjoy using your new website server template!

If you do not have an Editor which can highlight code, I would advise you to download Notepad++
(https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) for better readability in the config.php file.

- PHP 7.4 is required
- sockets extension in PHP is required

To check if you meet minimum requirements, download the Compatibility Check from the shop page and run it.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================
1. Change all information in the config.php as you please. Read the comments for additional information.
2. Make sure your webspace has the PHP sockets extensions enabled (by default most have)
3. Remove UPDATE.txt and README.txt from the files
4. Upload all the files to your webhost via FTP
5. Make sure the cache folder can be written to (permission 666)
=========================
