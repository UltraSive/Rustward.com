This update comes with a huge fix for the font used on the website, as well as an FAQ module!

v1.0.3
- Updated the font. The originally used font did not display unless you had it installed on your PC. The template should look much cleaner now.
- Added FAQ section to be able to provide more information to the users. It is disabled by default in your config file.
- Header texts of the sections (Shop, Rules, Staff, FAQ) can now be changed through the config
- Navigation link names of the sections ( Shop, Rules, Staff, FAQ) can now be changed through the config
- Fixed an issue where the server description would not be shown correctly (mostly on modded servers)
- Fixed list elements in the Shop list having the wrong color
- Changed button sizing in server popup
